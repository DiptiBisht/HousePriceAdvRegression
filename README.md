(1) Experiment with different regression methods to improve your predictions. Such experimentation should include hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation.

(2) Perform ensemble predictions (one-layer stacking) by combining predictions from some of the better performing algorithms. At the stacking layer, try at least three different models - e.g. decision tree, random forest, support vector machines.

(3) Perform hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation on the stacked model.

(4) Submit to Kaggle both individual and stacked model predictions and report all such Kaggle scores in an Excel table.
